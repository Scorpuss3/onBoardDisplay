It can display real-time diagnositic information about the vehicle, read from the ECU using and [ELM327](http://elmelectronics.com/DSheets/ELM327DS.pdf) Wi-Fi adaptor to connect to the OBDII port, which is present on most vehicles since 1997. It has the following features and more:\r\n* Read RPM, Speed, Manifold Absolute Pressure, etc... and present in in a virtual dashboard on-screen.\r\n* Read any error-codes the ECU has flagged\r\n  * Diagnose them for the user to understand.\r\n  * Locate them on vehicle (Custom vehicle packs created by me for a limited number)\r\n* Deactivation of the 'Check engine' light.\r\n\r\n### Project Background\r\nI have created this software mainly for an A-Level project. However, I was likely to do something similar anyway eventually! I chose this because it has allowed my to fulfill course requirements while also enjoying the project. You can track the progress of the build on the [Github Repository](https://github.com/Scorpuss3/onBoardDisplay)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
